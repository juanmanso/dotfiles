# Dotfiles

The goal of this repository is to have a centralized configuration repo so that whenever I change computers, my configuration stays the same and is easy to get it up-and-running

## Install

To install config repo in your `$HOME`, run:

```
/bin/bash curl -Lks https://github.com/juanmanso/dotfiles/blob/main/.bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```
